A little under 3 hours (incl breaks).  I'm spending the remaining time documenting for brownie points :)

* integrate tests App into server App
* execute tests as part of npm/package.json
* fix tests so they actually run and don't return false positives
* fix auth from /login
* save auth attempts to Mongo
* export auth attempts to feed
* refactor/create modules
* learn BDD
